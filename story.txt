Once upon a time, in a galaxy far, far away... 
on a volcanic thermal plant planet, there was a beaten down service bot.
The bot was downloading files from the deathstar on its mission to retrieve info on the last Jedi. 
*Beep beep boop* Almost complete!... Done. Let's take these blueprints to The Resistance.
It turned and started rolling down the hall. As it turned into the next corridor, the alarms sounded.
WAAAHH! WAAAHH! WAAAHH! Stormtroopers pour into the halls. There's been a breach! 
Stormtroopers swarmed in and surrounded the bot, all blaster pointed in the face of the defenseless bot..
Dozens of blasters go off at once. Pew pew pew! The bot is lost in a flurry of red beams. The dust settles... And the bot is gone. 
As the bot sped down the hall, it dodged the legs of people wearing blue clothing and vests.
*pssssh* The men in the blue clothing and vest pulled out their lightsabers to protect the fleeing bot from the information from being extracted. 
"Get BB134 to the ship!" One of the cloaked individuals shouts. The bot speeds out of the containment center with Jedi trailing behind. The blueprints are safe and headed to The Resistance...
