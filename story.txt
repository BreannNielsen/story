Once upon a time, in a galaxy far, far away... 
on a volcanic thermal plant planet, there was a beaten down service bot.
The bot was downloading files from the deathstar on its mission to retrieve info on the last Jedi. 
*Beep beep boop* Almost complete!... Done. Let's take these blueprints to The Resistance.
It turned and started rolling down the hall. As it turned into the next corridor, the alarms sounded.
WAAAHH! WAAAHH! WAAAHH! Stormtroopers pour into the halls. There's been a breach! 
Stormtroopers swarmed in and surrounded the bot, all blaster pointed in the face of the defenseless bot..
Dozens of blasters go off at once. Pew pew pew! The bot is lost in a flurry of red beams. The dust settles... And the bot is gone.
